> What is this?

As cool and convenient as [Create-React-App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) is, it makes it pretty difficult for developers to incorporate some packages into their own project. Plus, it's always a great idea to know what's going on behind the scene. 

I updated all dependencies to their latest version (as of July 14, 2019). 

**What's included**
* React
* Redux
* Babel
* Webpack
* ESLint, using the JavaScript Standard Library, added Prettier support for auto-formating within VSCode

**To get started**
1. `yarn install` to install all necessary dependencies specified in `package.json`
1.  `yarn start` to start dev server, go to `localhost:8080`.
1. To build, do `yarn build`
1. ~~`flow-typed:install` to get grab all available flow declaration for the packages you just installed from flow-typed repository.~~
1. ~~`flow` to check type coverage (flow configuration is in `/flow-coverage-config.json`)~~

**TODO**
1. Add Back Flow

Happy coding.
