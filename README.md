##Super duper clean Webpack React Starter Kit

###Hi strangers.

While I try to keep this template as clean as possible, there are still some dependencies you probably won't need. Free free to modify it to fit your own needs.
Some tech being used:
* React
* Flow
* Babel

To get started
1. `yarn install` to install all necessary dependencies specified in `package.json`
1. `flow-typed:install` to get grab all available flow declaration for the packages you just installed from flow-typed repository.
1. `flow` to check type coverage (flow configuration is in `/flow-coverage-config.json`)
1.  `yarn start` to start dev server, go to `localhost:4000`.
1. To build, do `yarn build`

Happy coding.
